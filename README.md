SpaceFnClaytron was inspired by [The SpaceFN Layout][spacefn-layout] from the [geekhack][geekhack] forums.
I primarily type on a Poker II or a MacBook Pro keyboard.

The Poker II is a 60% keyboard,
so it doesn't have function keys,
and escape is in a funny spot.
This was my primary motivation for embarking down this path.

## Details

For now, the note at the top of `SpaceFnClaytron.xml`.
See that file for more details on specific keyboard mappings.

This is intended for use with the Poker II, but also works with a mac
keyboard since there is nothing really special about these mappings.

My private.xml forces ESCAPE to be BACKQUOTE so that using the shell
is bearable with the Poker II. This allows the SpaceFN to be usable on
any keyboard.

I set up both WASD and HJKL for arrow keys, but obviously prefer the
vim style.

In addition to volume adjustment, there is also brightness mapped to C
and V, nothing special about those letters, just unused and close to
the N, M and Comma of the Poker II for volume.
